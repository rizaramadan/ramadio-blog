Imagine launching a project only to see it crumble disastrously. Sounds horrifying, right? Enter the Premortem: a powerful strategy that allows teams to forecast potential failures before they even occur.

Premortem is not just a fancy term but a practical application of a proactive mindset. Instead of reflecting on what went wrong after the fact (as in a postmortem), a premortem session is all about anticipating pitfalls and creating preventive strategies.

Premortem can be considered an application of [asking powerful question](/posts/asking-question)

### How Does It Work?
The process is deceptively simple but highly effective. Teams begin by visualizing a scenario where the project they're about to roll out turns into a catastrophe. Given this bleak premise, participants then take a short span of 5 to 10 minutes to draft a fictional history of this disaster. This narrative uncovers potential weak spots, risks, and uncertainties that might have been overlooked.

Once everyone has had a chance to pen down their thoughts, a group discussion ensues. Here, teams collaboratively dive deep into the causes of the imagined failure, examining every dark corner. The objective? To derive actionable insights and strategies that prevent these potential missteps from becoming a reality.

### Why Is It Beneficial?
By putting ourselves in the shoes of a future where things have already gone awry, we effectively turn our cognitive biases upside down. This shift in perspective allows for a fresh and critical examination of the plan, revealing vulnerabilities that might otherwise remain hidden.

For those intrigued by this technique, its roots trace back to the profound concept of 'inversion', eloquently discussed in [this article](https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/). Moreover, real-world applications and success stories, like those shared by Grubhub in their [blog post](https://bytes.grubhub.com/running-premortem-analysis-imagining-failure-to-ensure-success-8b8f1a153232), underscore its practical value.

### Getting Started
Before you jump into a premortem, ensure you have:
1. A concrete plan or strategy to dissect.
2. Not yet finalized your decision-making process.

In conclusion, while we can never predict the future with absolute certainty, strategies like the premortem provide us with robust tools to navigate potential challenges. So, the next time you're gearing up for a project, consider visualizing its post-failure world first. You might just unearth some golden insights to steer clear of potential icebergs.
