Test-Driven Development (TDD) has been a staple in software engineering for years, yet misconceptions still linger around its implementation and principles. Understanding these misconceptions is crucial for developers to effectively utilize TDD in their workflow.

## Misconception 1: TDD is Only for Unit Testing
A common misconception is that TDD is exclusively for unit tests. However, TDD encompasses more than just unit tests; it's a methodology that can be applied to all kinds of tests, including integration and functional testing. The essence of TDD is to write tests that guide the software development process, irrespective of the test level.

## Misconception 2: Inflexibility of Tests in TDD
Tests in TDD are often mistakenly viewed as rigid components. In reality, they embody the requirements. When a requirement changes, the corresponding test should also be modified. Conversely, if there are no changes in requirements but only in implementation details, the tests usually remain unchanged. However, there are rare exceptions where a change in implementation might necessitate adjusting a test, even without a change in requirements. As previously mentioned, these are rare occurrences, not common ones.

## Misconception 3: TDD Doesn't Apply in the Absence of Defined Requirements
In situations where a software developer is involved in the 'leftmost' process, the task revolves around discovering which technologies could resolve a current problem when requirements are not yet defined. In such scenarios, rapidly creating a prototype for feedback might seem to contradict TDD principles. However, this approach is, in fact, TDD itself. The prototype acts as a 'test' â€” it's a tangible representation of potential requirements and feedback mechanisms that will shape the final software product.

## Misconception 4: API Definitions Post-Test in Web Development
When developing a web API, the traditional view of strict TDD suggests that the API definition should be coded only after the test is written. However, a practical approach often involves defining the API in advance in the form of an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) or a Request for Comments (RFC). This pre-definition guides the creation of tests and aligns the development with broader architectural standards.

## Conclusion
TDD is a flexible and comprehensive methodology that adapts to various levels of testing and stages of software development. Dispelling these misconceptions is key to harnessing the full potential of TDD, ensuring that it remains an approach through which we can deliver software more quickly, easily, and with higher quality over time.
